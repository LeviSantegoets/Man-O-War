steps to use my program,

> 1 go to the bottom of the file and add your public ipv4 to the whitelist. the whole world is banned by default for hardcoded security reasons.

> 2 enjoy...

Development progress:
* program command activity logging must be extended to cover the whole program, but this slowed down production so i will need time to do so.

For contributers:
* if you have usefull functions to implement with apis curl vbs script powershell python or any other form like javascript pls send an email.
* this is an opensource program you may fork it to the brim if you'd like to

New Function Votes: "you may pick, we make all."
